The difficulty of this automatic collection is mainly caused by the variety of expressions in the papers, a robust system with tolerance to such variety is required to be developed. In this paper, we report an ongoing interdisciplinary work to construct a system for automatic collection of superconductor-related information from scientific literature using text mining techniques. We focused on the identification of superconducting material names and their critical temperature (Tc) key property. We discuss the construction of a prototype for extraction and linking using machine learning (ML) techniques for the physical information collection. From the evaluation using 500 sample documents, we define a baseline and a direction for future improvements.},

	abstract     = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).}

In this article we look at how data-driven techniques are playing a big role in deciphering processing-structure-property-performance relationships in materials with illustrative examples of both forward models property prediction and inverse models materials discovery . Such analytics can significantly reduce time-to-insight and accelerate cost-effective materials discovery which is the goal of MGI.},

Magnetic and superconducting materials exhibit a number of unique properties that make them useful in a wide variety of applications, including solid oxide fuel cells, solid-state refrigerants, photon detectors and metrology devices. In all these applications, phase transitions play an important role in determining the feasibility of the materials in question. Here, we present a pipeline for fully integrating data extracted from the scientific literature into machine-learning tools for property prediction and materials discovery. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning techniques, we successfully reconstruct the phase diagrams of well-known magnetic and superconducting compounds, and demonstrate that it is possible to predict the phase-transition temperatures of compounds not present in the database. We provide the tool as an online open-source platform, forming the basis for further research into magnetic and superconducting materials discovery for potential device applications.}

This ability to rapidly design interesting novel compounds has displaced the materials innovation bottleneck to the development of synthesis routes for the desired material. As there is no a fundamental theory for materials synthesis, one might attempt a data-driven approach for predicting inorganic materials synthesis, but this is impeded by the lack of a comprehensive database containing synthesis processes. To overcome this limitation, we have generated a dataset of “codified recipes” for solid-state synthesis automatically extracted from scientific publications. The dataset consists of 19,488 synthesis entries retrieved from 53,538 solid-state synthesis paragraphs by using text mining and natural language processing approaches. Every entry contains information about target material, starting compounds, operations used and their conditions, as well as the balanced chemical equation of the synthesis reaction. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for data mining of various aspects of inorganic materials synthesis.}

	abstract     = {Superconductivity has been the focus of enormous research effort since its discovery more than a century ago. Yet some features of this unique phenomenon remain poorly understood prime among these is the connection between superconductivity and chemical/structural properties of materials. To bridge the gap several machine learning schemes are developed herein to model the critical temperatures T mathrm c of the 12 000 known superconductors available via the SuperCon database. Materials are first divided into two classes based on their T mathrm c values above and below 10 K and a classification model predicting this label is trained. The model uses coarse-grained features based only on the chemical compositions. It shows strong predictive power with out-of-sample accuracy of about 92 . Separate regression models are developed to predict the values of T mathrm c for cuprate iron-based and low- T mathrm c compounds. These models also demonstrate good performance with learned predictors offering potential insights into the mechanisms behind superconductivity in different families of materials. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of these models new features are incorporated using materials data from the AFLOW Online Repositories. Finally the classification and regression models are combined into a single integrated pipeline and employed to search the entire Inorganic Crystallographic Structure Database ICSD for potential new superconductors. We identify more than 30 non-cuprate and non-iron-based oxides as candidate materials.},

	abstract     = {Background The exponential increase of published biomedical literature prompts the use of text mining tools to manage the information overload automatically. One of the most common applications is to mine protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from PubMed abstracts. Currently, most tools in mining PPIs from literature are using co-occurrence-based approaches or rule-based approaches. Hybrid methods (frame-based approaches) by combining these two methods may have better performance in predicting PPIs. However, the predicted PPIs from these methods are rarely evaluated by known PPI databases and co-occurred terms in Gene Ontology (GO) database.  Methodology/Principal Findings  We here developed a web-based tool, PPI Finder, to mine human PPIs from PubMed abstracts based on their co-occurrences and interaction words, followed by evidences in human PPI databases and shared terms in GO database. Only 28% of the co-occurred pairs in PubMed abstracts appeared in any of the commonly used human PPI databases (HPRD, BioGRID and BIND). On the other hand, of the known PPIs in HPRD, 69% showed co-occurrences in the literature, and 65% shared GO terms.  Conclusions PPI Finder provides a useful tool for biologists to uncover potential novel PPIs. It is freely accessible at http://liweilab.genetics.ac.cn/tm/.}

We provide a short overview of the general characteristics of natural language data, existing biomedical literature databases, and lexical resources relevant in the context of biomedical text mining. A selected number of practically useful systems are introduced together with the type of user queries supported and the results they generate. The extraction of biological relationships, such as protein--protein interactions as well as metabolic and signaling pathways using information extraction systems, will be discussed through example cases of cancer-relevant proteins. Basic strategies for detecting associations of genes to diseases together with literature mining of mutations, SNPs, and epigenetic information (methylation) are described. We provide an overview of disease-centric and gene-centric literature mining methods for linking genes to phenotypic and genotypic aspects. Moreover, we discuss recent efforts for finding biomarkers through text mining and for gene list analysis and prioritization. Some relevant issues for implementing a customized biomedical text mining system will be pointed out. To demonstrate the usefulness of literature mining for the molecular oncology domain, we implemented two cancer-related applications. The first tool consists of a literature mining system for retrieving human mutations together with supporting articles. Specific gene mutations are linked to a set of predefined cancer types. The second application consists of a text categorization system supporting breast cancer-specific literature search and document-based breast cancer gene ranking. Future trends in text mining emphasize the importance of community efforts such as the BioCreative challenge for the development and integration of multiple systems into a common platform provided by the BioCreative Metaserver.}

This paper aims at informing about the progress in this important research field. Superconducting transmission lines have a tremendous size advantage and lower total electrical losses for high capacity transmission plus a number of technological advantages compared to solutions based on standard conductors. This leads to a minimized environmental impact and enables an overall more sustainable transmission of electric energy. One of the direct benefits may be an increased public acceptance due to the low visual impact with a subsequent reduction of approval time. The access of remote renewable energy (RE) sources with high-capacity transmission is rendered possible with superior efficiency. That not only translates into further reducing CO2 emissions in a global energy mix that is still primarily based on fossils, but can also facilitate the development of RE sources given for instance the strong local opposition against the construction of new transmission lines. The socio-economic aspects of superconducting transmission lines based on the novel magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductor and on high-temperature superconductors (HTS) are compared to state-of-the-art HVDC overhead lines and underground cables based on resistive conductors.}

Tools of this kind, aiming to understand and make unstructured information accessible, represent the building blocks for large-scale Text and Data Mining (TDM) systems. Grobid-quantities is a module built on top of Grobid [6] [13], a machine learning framework for parsing and structuring PDF documents. Designed to process large quantities of data, it provides a robust implementation accessible in batch mode or via a REST API. The machine learning engine architecture follows the cascade approach, where each model is specialised in the resolution of a specific task. The models are trained using CRF (Conditional Random Field) algorithm [12] for extracting quantities (atomic values, intervals and lists), units (such as length, weight) and different value representations (numeric, alphabetic or scientific notation). Identified measurements are normalised according to the International System of Units (SI). Thanks to its stable recall and reliable precision, Grobid-quantities has been integrated as the measurement-extraction engine in various TDM projects, such as Marve (Measurement Context Extraction from Text), for extracting semantic measurements and meaning in Earth Science [10]. At the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan (NIMS), it is used in an ongoing project to discover new superconducting materials. Normalised materials characteristics (such as critical temperature, pressure) extracted from scientific literature are a key resource for materials informatics (MI) [9].},

Their discussion revealed that numerous misconceptions circulate in the content analysis literature regarding how these measures behave and can aid or deceive content analysts in their effort to ensure the reliability of their data. This article proposes three conditions for statistical measures to serve as indices of the reliability of data and examines the mathematical structure and the behavior of the five coefficients discussed by the authors, as well as two others. It compares common beliefs about these coefficients with what they actually do and concludes with alternative recommendations for testing reliability in content analysis and similar data-making efforts.}},

In particular, we introduce the concept of slot features, a novel constraint mechanism that allows modelling the interaction between semantic and syntactic annotations, as well as a new annotation user interface. The new features were developed and used in an annotation project for semantic roles on German texts. The paper briefly introduces this project and reports on experiences performing annotations with the new tool. On a comparative evaluation, our tool reaches significant speedups over WebAnno 2 for a semantic annotation task.}

METHODS: To build the gold standard, 1400 clinical trial announcements from the clinicaltrials.gov website were randomly selected and double annotated for diagnoses, signs, symptoms, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers, and SNOMED CT codes. We used two dictionary-based methods to pre-annotate the text. We evaluated the annotation time and potential bias through F-measures and ANOVA tests and implemented Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Time savings ranged from 13.85\% to 21.5\% per entity. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) ranged from 93.4\% to 95.5\%. There was no statistically significant difference for IAA and annotator performance in pre-annotations. CONCLUSIONS: On every experiment pair, the annotator with the pre-annotated text needed less time to annotate than the annotator with non-labeled text. The time savings were statistically significant. Moreover, the pre-annotation did not reduce the IAA or annotator performance. Dictionary-based pre-annotation is a feasible and practical method to reduce the cost of annotation of clinical named entity recognition in the eligibility sections of clinical trial announcements without introducing bias in the annotation process.},

Different from biomedical informatics, there exist very few corpora targeting Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). Especially, there is no sizable corpus which can be used to assist the search of superconducting materials. A team of materials scientists and natural language processing experts jointly designed the annotation and constructed a corpus consisting of manually-annotated 1,000 MSE abstracts related to superconductivity. We conducted experiments on the corpus with a neural Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool. The experimental results show that NER performance over the corpus is around 77{\%} in terms of micro-F1, which is comparable to human annotator agreement rates. Using the trained NER model, we automatically annotated 9,000 abstracts and created a term retrieval tool based on the term similarity. This tool can find superconductivity terms relevant to a query term within a specified Named Entity category, which demonstrates the power of our SC-CoMIcs, efficiently providing knowledge for Materials Informatics applications from rapidly expanding publications.},

Synthesis of a material is a complex process that depends not only on its thermodynamic stability with respect to others but also on factors from kinetics to advances in synthesis techniques to the availability of precursors. This complexity makes the development of a general theory or first-principles approach to synthesizability currently impractical. Here we show how an alternative pathway to predicting synthesizability emerges from the dynamics of the materials stability network: a scale-free network constructed by combining the convex free-energy surface of inorganic materials computed by high-throughput density functional theory and their experimental discovery timelines extracted from citations. The time-evolution of the underlying network properties allows us to use machine-learning to predict the likelihood that hypothetical computer-generated materials will be amenable to successful experimental synthesis.},

The main characteristic of the ternary diagram is the occurrence of two new ternary compounds Gd 5Si2B8 and Gd5Si3B 0.64. The former crystallizes in tetragonal symmetry space group P4/mbm with unit cell parameters a 7.2665 3 c 8.2229 7 the second one presents hexagonal symmetry space group P63/mcm with unit cell parameters a 8.5080 4 c 6.4141 2 . The X-ray structures of the two structurally related phases Gd5Si3B0.64 and host binary Gd5Si3 have been refined from three-dimensional single-crystal intensity data to the final R values of 0.036 Rw 0.046 and 0.046 Rw 0.055 for 457 and 401 reflections respectively with F 4 F . Both structures exhibit the Mn5Si3-type structure with in addition for Gd 5Si3B0.64 a partial occupancy by boron of the normally vacant interstitial site at the center of the Gd6 octahedron which corresponds to the origin of the unit cell. Bonding between the interstitial boron atoms and the gadolinium ones forming the Gd 6B polyhedra is indicated by the decrease in the corresponding Gd-Gd distances and consequently in the unit cell volume.

Sequential model-based optimization also known as Bayesian optimization is one of the most efficient methods per function evaluation of function minimization. This efficiency makes it appropriate for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms that are slow to train. The Hyperopt library provides algorithms and parallelization infrastructure for performing hyperparameter optimization model selection in Python. This paper presents an introductory tutorial on the usage of the Hyperopt library including the description of search spaces minimization in serial and parallel and the analysis of the results collected in the course of minimization. This paper also gives an overview of Hyperopt-Sklearn a software project that provides automatic algorithm configuration of the Scikit-learn machine learning library. Following Auto-Weka we take the view that the choice of classifier and even the choice of preprocessing module can be taken together to represent a single large hyperparameter optimization problem. We use Hyperopt to define a search space that encompasses many standard components e.g. SVM RF KNN PCA TFIDF and common patterns of composing them together. We demonstrate using search algorithms in Hyperopt and standard benchmarking data sets MNIST 20-newsgroups convex shapes that searching this space is practical and effective. In particular we improve on best-known scores for the model space for both MNIST and convex shapes. The paper closes with some discussion of ongoing and future work.},

There is however no general method for screening materials for such an entropy change without actually performing the relevant time- and effort-intensive magnetic measurements.

	abstract     = {A simplified model for predicting the general trends of active magnetic regenerator devices is presented. To reduce computational demands it is assumed the regenerator has sufficiently high convective interaction such that a one-phase regenerator approximation is sufficient. A corrective term is subsequently added to the thermal conductivity to account for the convective heat leak. Losses internal and external to the regenerator are also defined for a generalized AMR device. The steady state temperature span across the regenerator is then evaluated using an energy balance and real material properties with the cooling capacity work inputs and COP post-calculated using the result. A comparison of the simplified model with experimental results was performed using single-layer and multilayer regenerators of Gd Gd 0.74Tb0.26 and Gd0.85Er0.15. The model showed good conformity in magnitude and sensitivity in all of the scenarios which varied by heat load frequency and utilization. 2012 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.},

We find that the Curie temperature T C gradually increases upon Dy substitution while the magnitude of the magnetic entropy change S M and adiabatic temperature change T ad showed a gradual decrease.

Here, an in-depth review of the application of ML to energy materials, including rechargeable alkali-ion batteries, photovoltaics, catalysts, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, and superconductors, is presented. A conceptual framework is first provided for ML in materials science, with a broad overview of different ML techniques as well as best practices. This is followed by a critical discussion of how ML is applied in energy materials. This review is concluded with the perspectives on major challenges and opportunities in this exciting field.},

Evaluation of the database shows an estimated overall precision of 73 . Therein records processed with the text-mining toolkit ChemDataExtractor were assisted by a modified Snowball algorithm whose original binary relationship extraction capabilities were extended to quaternary relationship extraction. Consequently its machine learning component can now train with 500 seeds rather than the 4 000 originally used. Data processed with the modified Snowball algorithm affords 82 precision. Database records are available in MongoDB CSV and JSON formats which can easily be read using Python R Java and MatLab.

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis performed at room temperature revealed that all studied solid solutions solidify with the formation of a Laves-phase MgCu 2-type structure space group Fd-3m . The magnetization behavior and the magnetic transition are analyzed in terms of the Landau theory. The studies of magnetic properties and heat capacity showed that a relatively small Gd addition significantly increases TC of the compounds. The maximum percentage increase in TC namely 43 was observed for Ho 0.9Er0.1 1-xGdxCo2. However the highest temperature was noted for the Dy0.9Ho 0.1 0.85Gd0.15Co2 solid solution it is TC 183.4 K. Below the ordering temperature all samples are ferrimagnetically ordered at high temperatures they are Curie-Weiss paramagnets. Moreover a small Gd addition eliminates the field-induced magnetic transition near TC and as consequence transforms the nature of magnetic transition from the first- to second-order. The magnetocaloric effect has been estimated in terms of both isothermal magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes. The highest adiabatic temperature change T ad 3 K and highest isothermal entropy change S mag 12.1 J/kg K were observed for Ho0.9Er 0.1 0.95Gd0.05Co2 at 90 K in magnetic fields of 2 T and 3 T respectively. A decrease in the entropy change has been observed with increasing Gd content in all studied samples. The smallest values of Smag were observed for the Dy 0.9Ho0.1 1-xGdxCo2 solid solutions. Under an external field change of from 0 to 3 T the maximum entropy change for Dy0.9Ho0.1 1-xGdxCo 2 compounds decreases from 6.9 at x 0.05-4.3 J/kg K at x 0.15. The refrigerant capacity for all solid solutions with 0.05 x 0.15 is reported. The effect of increasing Gd content in the solid solutions on their magnetic and magnetocaloric properties is discussed. 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Low-temperature magnetic refrigeration has attracted the attention of the cryogenics research community in the areas of technology in space science and in the liquefaction of hydrogen or other fuel gases although it has been less researched compared to room-temperature magnetic refrigeration. Here we report that the RVO 4 R Gd Ho Er and Yb series is promising for low-temperature cryogenic refrigeration. GdVO 4 is the most promising material exhibiting a maximum magnetocaloric effect S maxM of 41.1 J kg 1 K 1 at 3 K for a change in field H of 50 kOe. The values of S maxM are also promising with 7.94 J kg 1 K 1 at 15 K 19.7 J kg 1 K 1 at 2 K and 17.4 J kg 1 K 1 at 2 K with H 50 kOe for HoVO 4 ErVO 4 and YbVO 4 respectively. The maximum value of adiabatic temperature change T maxad attributed to the large magnetocaloric effect is 18 K for GdVO 4 with H 50 kOe. The results further indicate that demagnetization with 50 kOe field close to the liquid hydrogen temperature at 20.3 K leads to the remarkable decrease of temperature to 3.5 K. Satisfying its potential as a refrigerant material the thermal hysteresis of magnetization is negligible and the values of S maxM and T maxad are as high as 12.4 J kg 1 K 1 and 8.5 K for 20 kOe change in field which can be achieved without a superconducting magnet.},

This work uses model magnetocaloric materials and a numerical AMR model to predict how the temperature change and entropy change with magnetization interact and how they affect the performance of a practical system. The distribution of the magnetocaloric effect as a function of temperature was also studied. It was found that the adiabatic temperature change in a magnetocaloric material can be more important than the isothermal entropy change for certain conditions. A material that exhibits a sharp peak in isothermal entropy change was shown to produce a significantly lower cooling power than a material with a wide peak in a practical AMR system. 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

The MCEs increase while TC decreases with increasing Fe concentration. Therefore TC of these compounds should be controlled up to room temperature from the viewpoint of practical applications. The working temperature as magnetic refrigerants is extended from about 185 to 330 K by adjusting hydrogen concentration. After hydrogen absorption the MCEs as well as the thermal conductivity of La Fe xSi1-x 13 and their hydrides exhibit excellent characteristics in the temperature range mentioned above.

We evaluate to what extent the raw materials needed to produce this kind of technology on a mass-market scale are critical in terms of demand and supply thus identifying potential supply bottlenecks that might hinder the breakthrough of this promising technology. We assess the criticality of three promising magnetocaloric materials that is Gd5 SiGe 4 La FeSi 13 and MnFe 2P as well as of Nd2Fe14B as the candidate permanent magnet material to drive the cooling cycle. The Gd-based alloys are disqualified as a mass-market refrigerant in terms of resource criticality whereas La- and Mn-based alloys are much less problematic.

In this scale the electronegativity is an intrinsic free-atom property and the basis of assumption is quantum mechanically viable. The qualitative relation between the size and electronegativity is relied upon and a quantitative general formula of evaluation of electronegativity in terms of the absolute radii of atoms is suggested as a 1/R b where is electronegativity and R is absolute radius of atoms a and b are two constants determined by least square fitting for each period of elements separately. A number known as electronegativity is computed for each 103 elements of periodic table through the above formula and the unit assigned to is energy. The new scale of electronegativity is found to observe the simple rules that all the scales of electronegativity must obey. The evaluated scale reproduces the silicon rule where the electronegativities of the eight elements of metalloid group are very close to each other and the electronegativity of silicon atom is smallest of the group. A striking feature of the new scale is that the electronegativity of N atom is greater than that of Cl atom. The characteristic properties of chalcogens and transition metal atoms have been nicely correlated in terms of the computed values of of such elements. The evaluated electronegativities of the elements beautifully exhibit the periodic behaviour of periods and groups of the Periodic Table. The revealed internal consistencies suggest that the present effort of introducing a scale of electronegativity based on absolute radius of atoms is largely successful.},

In this study we have explored recent experimental results in HoAl2 single crystals and polycrystalline samples. HoAl2 presents a spin reorientation transition at 20 K and different signatures of this phenomenon are reproduced in our calculations. In addition we have calculated the anisotropic variation of magnetic entropy that corresponds to a rotation of a HoAl2 single crystal from its 110 towards its 100 direction in the presence of a constant applied magnetic field. The intensity of the anisotropic effect is twice that one of the conventional effect at spin reorientation region. A subtle signature of the spin reorientation is also observed in the 111 direction. We conclude that the crystal electric field term plays the principal role to describe the main magnetic characteristics of the system not being necessary to include in the Hamiltonian others effects such as elastic or high order magnetic interactions.},

Here, we present a materials-aware language model, namely, MatSciBERT, trained on a large corpus of peer-reviewed materials science publications. We show that MatSciBERT outperforms SciBERT, a language model trained on science corpus, and establish state-of-the-art results on three downstream tasks, named entity recognition, relation classification, and abstract classification. We make the pre-trained weights of MatSciBERT publicly accessible for accelerated materials discovery and information extraction from materials science texts.}

This review focuses on the state-of-the-art hard and soft magnets and magnetocaloric materials with an emphasis on their optimization for energy applications. Specifically the impact of hard magnets on electric motor and transportation technologies of soft magnetic materials on electricity generation and conversion technologies and of magnetocaloric materials for refrigeration technologies are discussed.

It is a real obstacle on the path from existing laboratoryscale prototypes of magnetic refrigerators towards commercialization of this potentially disruptive cooling technology. Indeed the reversibility of the magnetocaloric effect being essential for magnetic heat pumps strongly depends on the width of the thermal hysteresis and therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanisms causing hysteresis and to find solutions to minimize losses associated with thermal hysteresis in order to maximize the efficiency of magnetic cooling devices. In this work we discuss the fundamental aspects that can contribute to thermal hysteresis and the strategies that we are developing to at least partially overcome the hysteresis problem in some selected classes of magnetocaloric materials with large application potential. In doing so we refer to the most relevant classes of magnetic refrigerants La-Fe-Si- Heusler- and Fe2 P-type compounds.

From analyses of these results the total entropies S and the magnetic entropy changes DELTA S//J of the RAl//2 series were determined. It is made clear that a large enough value of DELTA S//J to make refrigeration can be induced by the external magnetic field near T//c and also that the temperature corresponding to the maximum value of DELTA S//J is adjustable by making a solid solution between the compounds in the RAl//2 series.

This proportionality was significantly improved by introducing a modified de Gennes factor bi. The conventional de Gennes factor indicates the exchange interaction given by the inner product of the effective spin components of ions of the same kind whereas our modified de Gennes factor bi also considers interactions between different kinds of ions and statistical factors calculated on the basis of the binomial distribution. The good proportionality obtained between TC and bi indicates that the spin components of RE ions interact with each other.

In particular machine learning techniques have been demonstrated for their utility in rapidly and automatically identifying potential composition-phase maps from structural data characterization of composition spread libraries enabling rapid materials fabrication-structure-property analysis and functional materials discovery. A key issue in development of an automated phase-diagram determination method is the choice of dissimilarity measure or kernel function. The desired measure reduces the impact of confounding structural data issues on analysis performance. The issues include peak height changes and peak shifting due to lattice constant change as a function of composition. In this work we investigate the choice of dissimilarity measure in X-ray diffraction-based structure analysis and the choice of measure s performance impact on automatic composition-phase map determination. Nine dissimilarity measures are investigated for their impact in analyzing X-ray diffraction patterns for a Fe-Co-Ni ternary alloy composition spread. The cosine Pearson correlation coefficient and Jensen-Shannon divergence measures are shown to provide the best performance in the presence of peak height change and peak shifting due to lattice constant change when the magnitude of peak shifting is unknown. With prior knowledge of the maximum peak shifting dynamic time warping in a normalized constrained mode provides the best performance. This work also serves to demonstrate a strategy for rapid analysis of a large number of X-ray diffraction patterns in general beyond data from combinatorial libraries.},

In general two magnetic ordering transitions are found T c1 is attributed to ferromagnetic ordering of the itinerant Cr sublattice and at lower temperatures T c2 is attributed to ordering of the localized rare-earth sublattice. Alloying on the rare-earth site varies the de Gennes factor DG g 1 2 JJ 1 and dT c1 / dDG 2 K while dT c2 / dDG 5 K. These ordering temperatures are found to converge at GdCrSb 3 where a single ferrimagnetic transition is found at T c2 86 K due to an antialignment of the itinerant Cr magnetic sublattice and the localized rare-earth magnetic sublattice. Initially for DG 3.5 the two magnetic sublattices order in a ferromagnetic ground state and the paramagnetic Weiss temperature decreases at the same rate as T c1. But for DG 4.5 the rare-earth magnetic sublattice antialigns with respect to the Cr sublattice and the Weiss temperature decreases five times as fast. In the region between 3.5 DG 4.5 a first-order phase transition is found at T c2 .},

	abstract     = {Vegard s law has been used extensively in mineralogy metallurgy and materials science for the past six decades. According to the law unit cell parameters should vary linearly with composition for a continuous substitutional solid solution in which atoms or ions that substitute for each other are randomly distributed. Although the law was postulated on empirical evidence several cases of both positive and negative deviations from this law have been documented. Its theoretical foundations have not been critically explored. Presented in this communication is an analysis of the law within the framework of solution thermodynamics. It is shown that the deviation from Vegard s law is expected even for thermodynamically ideal solutions when there is a significant difference in lattice parameters of the pure components. The law should be reclassified as an approximation valid for specific conditions. The approximation is valid for ideal solutions when the lattice parameters of the pure components differ by less than 5 . For solid solutions with positive deviations from ideality there will always be positive deviations from Vegard s law. For solid solutions with moderately negative deviations from ideality positive deviation from linearity of lattice parameters caused by size mismatch can be compensated for by the attractive interaction between the components resulting in compliance with Vegard s law.},

Most experts suggest that hydrogen as an alternative fuel has the elements to address all three of these concerns. In its purest form there are zero emissions the supply is endless and production may use a variety of energy sources including renewable. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the challenges related to moving to a hydrogen-fueled economy. The efforts of some countries and leaders in the automotive sector are reviewed as they strive to develop the technology and find possible answers to production storage and distribution challenges. There are many opinions on how best to proceed. Some favor moving directly to a hydrogen infrastructure while others advocate transitioning by using hydrogen fuel cell technology.

Magnetic refrigeration makes use of the magnetocaloric effect and is well known as an efficient method in principal because its cooling cycle can closely follow the Carnot cycle with appropriate heat switches. A liquefaction principle of our magnetic refrigerator is based on a thermo-siphon method in which liquid hydrogen is condensed directly onto the surface of magnetic refrigerants and drops downward. Therefore the magnetic refrigerants are required to have relatively large entropy change at liquefaction temperature of hydrogen and hydrogen resistance. Since most metal compounds don t satisfy the latter condition we have developed a new ceramic polycrystal magnetic refrigerant named dysprosium gadolinium aluminum garnet DGAG . In the liquefaction experiments we have successfully liquefied hydrogen gas preliminarily cooled to a temperature slightly above the boiling point. Liquefaction was confirmed by the temperature variation of the DGAG and the resultant condensation efficiency was found to approach 90 of the Carnot efficiency. The maximum cooling power was 14.6 W.}

Extensive magnetization measurements have been performed on several metallic glasses over a fairly wide temperature range around TC Curie temperature which embraces the narrow temperature region T-TC /TC 0.1 covered in our earlier studies on some of these materials. The results deduced from a detailed analysis re-analysis of the present data published data are compared with those previously reported on crystalline ferromagnets and with the predictions of the existing theories. Such efforts culminate in a number of important findings that include: i critical properties of the pure ordered system are preserved so long as the disorder present is mainly of topological character marked deviations from the pure behavior occur when the compositional disorder dominantly contributes to the quenched disorder present ii in the weak and intermediate disorder regimes quenched disorder does not significantly alter the width of the pure asymptotic critical region and iii for compositions in the close proximity to the percolation threshold only a small fraction of spins participates in the magnetic order-disorder transition.

The Curie temperature shifts to higher temperatures while the spin reorientation transition shifts to lower temperatures with increasing Dy concentration.

Powder x-ray diffraction of the as-grown crystal revealed that PrSi crystallizes in an FeB-type structure with space group Pnma No. 62 . The anisotropic magnetic properties were investigated by means of magnetic susceptibility isothermal magnetization electrical transport and heat capacity measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data clearly indicate the ferromagnetic transition in PrSi with a T C of 52 K. The relative easy axis of magnetization was found to be the 010 direction. Heat capacity data confirm the bulk nature of the transition at 52 K and exhibit a huge anomaly at the transition. A sharp rise in the low-temperature heat capacity has been observed below 5 K which is attributed to the 141 Pr nuclear Schottky heat capacity arising from the hyperfine field of the Pr moment. The estimated Pr magnetic moment 2.88 B /Pr from the hyperfine splitting is in agreement with the saturation magnetization value obtained from the magnetization data measured at 2 K. From the crystal electric field analysis of the magnetic susceptibility magnetization and heat capacity data it is found that the degenerate J 4 Hund s rule derived state of the Pr 3 ion splits into nine singlets with an overall splitting of 284 K the first excited singlet state separated by just 9 K from the ground state. The magnetic ordering in PrGe appears to be due to the exchange-generated admixture of low-lying crystal field levels. The magnetocaloric effect MCE has been investigated from magnetization data along all three principal crystallographic directions. The large magnetic entropy change S M 22.2 J/kg K and the relative cooling power RCP 460 J/kg characteristic of the giant magnetocaloric effect are achieved near the transition temperature T C 52 K for H 70 kOe along 010 . Furthermore the PrSi single crystal exhibits a giant MCE anisotropy.},

	abstract     = {The solid-state magnetic cooling MC relying on magnetocaloric effect MCE of magnetic materials is recognized as a promising energy efficiency and environmentally friendly technology. However there is still a large gap between the fundamental materials in the laboratory developing stage and the practically realizable applications. In this paper a new series of B-site ordered RE2ZnMnO6 RE Gd Dy and Ho perovskites are successfully fabricated and their structural and magnetic properties together with the cryogenic magnetocaloric performances are studied in detail. All the RE2ZnMnO6 compounds are found to crystallize in the B-site ordered orthorhombic double perovskites structure with the space group of P121/C1. The magnetic ground state are confirmed to be a ferromagnetic FM coupling for Gd2ZnMnO6 whereas ferrimagnetic FIM coupling for Dy2ZnMnO6 and Ho2ZnMnO6 based on the magnetic measurements and first principle calculations. The ordering temperatures TM are determined to be 6.4 K for Gd2ZnMnO6 10.4 K for Dy2ZnMnO6 and 6.8 K for Ho2ZnMnO6 respectively. Furthermore several vital parameters for determining the magnetocaloric performances including - SMmax magnetic entropy change peak values TEC 2 temperature-averaged magnetic entropy change and RCP relative cooling powers are evaluted to be 15.17 14.44 J/ kgK and 226 J/kg for Gd2ZnMnO6 8.32 8.17 J/ kgK and 208 J/kg for Dy2ZnMnO6 and 13.19 12.68 J/ kgK and 246 J/kg for Ho2ZnMnO6 with the field change H 50 kOe respectively. It is worthly noted that Gd2ZnMnO6 exhibits relatively great magnetocaloric performances below 10 K which suggests that Gd2ZnMnO6 is a competitive candidate for cryogenic magnetic cooling.},

	abstract     = {We present a comprehensive information extraction system dedicated to software entities in scientific literature. This task combines the complexity of automatic reading of scientific documents (PDF processing, document structuring, styled/rich text, scaling) with challenges specific to mining software entities: high heterogeneity and extreme sparsity of mentions, document-level cross-references, disambiguation of noisy software mentions and poor portability of Machine Learning approaches between highly specialized domains. While NER is a key component to recognize new and unseen software, considering this task as a simple NER application fails to address most of these issues.In this paper, we propose a multi-model Machine Learning approach where raw documents are ingested by a cascade of document structuring processes applied not to text, but to layout token elements. The cascading process further enriches the relevant structures of the document with a Deep Learning software mention recognizer adapted to the high sparsity of mentions. The Machine Learning cascade culminates with entity disambiguation to alleviate false positives and to provide software entity linking. A bibliographical reference resolution is integrated to the process for attaching references cited alongside the software mentions.Based on the first gold-standard annotated dataset developed for software mentions, this work establishes a new reference end-to-end performance for this task. Experiments with the CORD-19 publications have further demonstrated that our system provides practically usable performance and is scalable to the whole scientific corpus, enabling novel applications for crediting research software and for better understanding the impact of software in science.},

The paramagnetic Curie temperature is -20 K suggesting the presence of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in this compound. The magnetization does not seem to saturate even in fields of 90 kOe at 3 K consistent with the presence of competing interactions. Saturation magnetization value extrapolated to 1/H 0 of only 0.8 B/Ce3 is obtained compared to the free ion value of 2.14 B/Ce3 . This moment reduction in the ordered state of Ce5Ge4 could be due to partial antiferromagnetic/paramagnetic ordering of the Ce moments and may also be due to crystalline electric field effects.

Below TORD the magnetization measurements together with neutron powder diffraction show complex magnetic behaviors and reveal the existence of up to three additional phase transitions believed to be a result of large anisotropic exchange and/or crystal electric field effects induced high anisotropy.

In this second part, we report the results: in Mo2C1−x, a first order transformation between an orthorhombic ζ-Fe2N-type superstructure and a hexagonal ϵ-Fe2N-type one has been identified in a middle temperature range (1100–1400°C); in the case of W2C1−x, the same ϵ-Fe2N-type phase appears to be the major constituent in our powders. In both carbides, the disordering of this ϵ-phase occurs through a second order transition at elevated temperatures. The ζ-Fe2N-type phase is also observed as a minor constituent of a W2C0.91 powder; a consistent discussion of these results points out a general scheme for the structural evolution of these M2C1−x compounds as a function of the temperature; this conclusion is also correlated to the refinement of the ζ and ϵ-type structures which has been performed at room temperature. Résumé Dans la première partie de ce travail [Acta metall.36, 1891 (1988)], nous avons présenté les procédures experimentales relatives à une étude in situ des hémicarbures métalliques M2C par diffraction de neutrons à haute température. Dans cette seconde partie, nous rapportons les résultats. Dans le cas de Mo2C1−x, on observe une transition du premier ordre entre les phases de types ζ-Fe2N (orthorhombique) et ϵ-Fe2N (hexagonale), entre 1100 et 1400°C; cette même phase de type ϵ est le composant majoritaire des échantillons W2C1−x. Dans les 2 carbures, la phase de type ϵ se désordonne à plus haute température, la transition étant vraisemblablement du second ordre. La phase de type ζ est également observée en très petite quantité dans le composé W2C0.91. Ces résultats sont discutés de manière cohérente, et un schéma général de l'évolution structurale de ces hémicarbures en fonction de la température est proposé: le lien est d'ailleurs fait avec les affinements des structures ζ et ϵ qui ont été entrepris à température ambiante. Zusammenfassung Im ersten Teil dieser Arbeit [Acta metall.36, 1891 (1988)], werden die experimentelle Methoden für ein in situ Neutronbeugungsuntersuchung der metallischen Subcarbiden M2C1−x mit verschieden Zusammensetzungen bei hohen Temperaturen beschrieben. In diesem Zweiten Teil zeigen wir die Ergebnisse. Im Mo2C1−x, wurde zwischen 1100 und 1400°C ein Übergang erster Ordnung von der orthorhombischen ζ-Fe2N-Typ zur hexagonal ϵ-Fe2N-Typ Überstruktur beobachtet. Im Falle des Subcarbides W2C1−x ist die ϵ-Fe2N-Typ Phase vorwiegend. Im beide Carbiden tritt die Ordnung-Entordnungs Umwandlung dieser ϵ-Phase bei höheren Temperaturen auf; dieser Übergang scheint zweiter Ordnung zu sein. Die ζ-Fe2N-Typ Struktur ist auch als ein kleiner Anteil der W2C0.91 Pulveransätze beobachtet worden. Mit Hilfe eines allgemeinen Modelles für die strukturelle thermische Umwandlung in beiden Carbiden, werden diese Ergebnisse anhand die Bestimmung der ζ- und ϵ-Strukturen bei Raumtemperatur diskutiert.}

We build kernel-based ML models to predict optimal chemical compositions for new permanent magnets which are key components in many green-energy technologies. The magnetic-property data used for training and testing the ML models are obtained from a combinatorial high-throughput screening based on density-functional theory calculations. Our straightforward choice of describing the different configurations enables the subsequent use of the ML models for compositional optimization and thereby the prediction of promising substitutes of state-of-the-art magnetic materials like Nd 2 Fe 14 B with similar intrinsic hard-magnetic properties but a lower amount of critical rare-earth elements.},

However the goal of building commercially viable magnetic refrigeration systems with high performance and competitive price has not been achieved yet. One of the obstacles to reach this goal is the inadequate properties of the currently existing magnetocaloric materials. In this article the needed improvements in the properties of the magnetocaloric materials are investigated. Two existing vapor-compression refrigerators are used as reference for the required performance and magnetic refrigerators are simulated using a numerical model. Apart from the requirements such as uniformity of transition temperature for each layer small increment in transition temperature in adjacent layers and mechanical strength of the materials the study shows that for the investigated cases materials with adiabatic entropy change 2.35 times larger than the existing materials are needed to outperform vapor-compression systems.},

The slightly enhanced electronic specific heat the Debye temperature around 150 K and the presence of the magnetic specific heat well above the ordering temperature are also characteristic of many other compounds of the R3M family R Rare Earth . The specific heat for Tb3Ru however presents two peaks at 37 K and 74 K. The magnetization shows that below the first peak the system presents an antiferromagnetic behavior and is paramagnetic above 74 K.

The magnetocaloric effect was evaluated as a function of x by calculating the magnetic entropy changes S from the magnetization data sets measured at various temperatures and applied fields. The S values of GdxDy1-xN expressed in terms of J K-1 m-3 were comparable to those of intermetallic compounds of rare earth and transition metals previously reported.

Fuel cells with their high electrical efficiencies and clean exhaust energy conversion have the potential to produce excellent solutions to the ecological and economic problems provided that their development is pursued in a determined way and that their market launch is prepared. Based on experiences and results from intensive R D and demonstration programmes in the last decades regional national European and international efforts are underway to overcome existing bottlenecks through efforts reaching from fundamental research to market introduction instruments.

High-throughput electronic structure theory may help to explore the vast chemical space available and offers a design tool to the experimental synthesis. This method efficiently predicts the elementary magnetic properties of a compound and its thermodynamical stability but it is blind to information concerning the magnetic critical temperature. Here we introduce a range of machine-learning models to predict the Curie temperature T mathrm C of ferromagnets. The models are constructed by using experimental data for about 2 500 known magnets and consider the chemical composition of a compound as the only feature determining T mathrm C . Thus we are able to establish a one-to-one relation between the chemical composition and the critical temperature. We show that the best model can predict T mathrm C s with an accuracy of about 50K. Most importantly our model is able to extrapolate the predictions to regions of the chemical space where only a little fraction of the data was considered for training. This is demonstrated by tracing the T mathrm C of binary intermetallic alloys along their composition space and for the Al-Co-Fe ternary system.},

In particular liquid hydrogen can be utilized for infrastructure construction consisting of storage and transportation. When we compare the consuming energy of hydrogen liquefaction with high pressurized hydrogen gas FOM must be larger than 0.57 for hydrogen liquefaction. Thus we need to develop a highly efficient liquefaction method. Magnetic refrigeration using the magneto-caloric effect has potential to realize not only the higher liquefaction efficiency 50 but also to be environmentally friendly and cost effective. Our hydrogen magnetic refrigeration system consists of Carnot cycle for liquefaction stage and AMR active magnetic regenerator cycle for precooling stages. For the Carnot cycle we develop the high efficient system with 80 liquefaction efficiency by using the heat pipe. For the AMR cycle we studied two kinds of displacer systems which transferred the working fluid. We confirmed the AMR effect with the cooling temperature span of 12 K for 1.8 T of the magnetic field and 6 s of the cycle. By using the simulation we estimate the efficiency of the hydrogen liquefaction plant for 10 kg/day. A FOM of 0.47 is obtained for operation temperature between 20 K and 77 K including LN 2 work input. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by 1 defining core Python objects for materials data representation 2 providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications and 3 establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project s REpresentational State Transfer REST Application Programming Interface API . As an example using pymatgen s interface to the Materials Project s RESTful API and phasediagram package we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material Li 4SnS4 can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The sure independence screening and sparsifying operator SISSO tackles immense and correlated features spaces and converges to the optimal solution from a combination of features relevant to the materials property of interest. In addition SISSO gives stable results also with small training sets. The methodology is benchmarked with the quantitative prediction of the ground-state enthalpies of octet binary materials using ab initio data and applied to the showcase example of predicting the metal/insulator classification of binaries with experimental data . Accurate predictive models are found in both cases. For the metal-insulator classification model the predictive capability is tested beyond the training data: It rediscovers the available pressure-induced insulator-to-metal transitions and it allows for the prediction of yet unknown transition candidates ripe for experimental validation. As a step forward with respect to previous model-identification methods SISSO can become an effective tool for automatic materials development.},

	abstract     = {The experimental investigation of an active magnetic regenerative refrigerator AMRR operating between 77 K and 20 K is discussed in this paper with detailed energy transfer analysis. A multi-layered active magnetic regenerator AMR is used which consists of four different rare earth intermetallic compounds in the form of irregular powder. Numerical simulation confirms that the AMR can attain its target operating temperature range. Magnetic field alternation throughout the AMR is generated by a high temperature superconducting HTS magnet. The HTS magnet is cooled by a two stage Gifford-McMahon GM cryocooler. Helium gas was employed as a working fluid and its oscillating flow in the AMR is controlled in accordance with the magnetic field variation. The AMR is divided into two stages and each stage has a different mass flow rate as needed to achieve the desired cooling performance. The temperature variation of the AMR during the experiment is monitored by temperature sensors installed inside the AMR. The experimental results show that the AMRR is capable of achieving no-load temperature of 25.4 K while the warm end temperature is 77 K. The performance of the AMRR is analyzed by observing internal temperature variations at cyclic steady state. Furthermore numerical estimation of the cooling capacity and the temperature variation of the AMR are examined and compared with the experimental results.},

However the development of a new high-performance magnet is a long and often unpredictable process and only about two dozen magnets are featured in mainstream applications. We describe a systematic pathway to the design of novel magnetic materials which demonstrates a high throughput and discovery speed. On the basis of an extensive electronic structure library of Heusler alloys containing 236 115 prototypical compounds we filtered those displaying magnetic order and established whether they can be fabricated at thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically we carried out a full stability analysis of intermetallic Heusler alloys made only of transition metals. Among the possible 36 540 prototypes 248 were thermodynamically stable but only 20 were magnetic. The magnetic ordering temperature TC was estimated by a regression calibrated on the experimental TC of about 60 known compounds. As a final validation we attempted the synthesis of a few of the predicted compounds and produced two new magnets: Co2MnTi which displays a remarkably high TC in perfect agreement with the predictions and Mn2PtPd which is an antiferromagnet. Our work paves the way for large-scale design of novel magnetic materials at potentially high speed.},

However several problems stand in the way of its large-scale production and long-term storage. This includes problems associated with energy consumed in liquefaction as well as boil-off losses during storage and handling. Boil-off losses occur due to a variety of mechanisms such as ortho-para conversion thermal stratification and self pressurization heat leaks sloshing and flashing.

Although supplanted by more powerful dilution refrigerators in the 1960s ADRs have experienced a revival due to the needs of the space community for cooling astronomical instruments and detectors to temperatures below 100 mK. The earliest of these were single-stage refrigerators using superfluid helium as a heat sink. Their modest cooling power 1 W at 60 mK 1 was sufficient for the small 6 6 detector arrays 2 but recent advances in arraying and multiplexing technologies 3 are generating a need for higher cooling power 5-10 W and lower temperature 30 mK . Single-stage ADRs have both practical and fundamental limits to their operating range as mass grows very rapidly as the operating range is expanded. This has led to the development of new architectures that introduce multi-staging as a way to improve operating range efficiency and cooling power. Multi-staging also enables ADRs to be configured for continuous operation which greatly improves cooling power per unit mass. This paper reviews the current field of adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration beginning with a description of the magnetocaloric effect and its application in single-stage systems and then describing the challenges and capabilities of multi-stage and continuous ADRs.

It is suggested that this rule may be exploited to screen intermetallic compounds for prospective thermoelectric materials. The rule was applied to several structure types of known deltahedral boride and borocarbide compounds and its predictions were compared to those of first principles electronic structure calculations when such were available in the literature or to published reports of transport properties. In addition the rule has been used to predict the properties of several materials for which the electronic structure and properties have not hitherto been reported. In accordance with these predictions layered ternary boride intermetallic compounds with structure types YCrB4 and Er 3CrB7 were synthesized and the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficients of these alloys were measured from room temperature to 1100 K. Alloys of composition RMB4 R Y Gd Ho M Cr Mo W were found to be n-type semiconductors and to exhibit thermopower up to 70-115 V/K the band gap was estimated to range from 0.17 to 0.28 eV depending on composition.

The inherent instability of Co sublattice magnetism is responsible for the occurrence of IEM which leads to interesting magnetic and related physical properties. The systematic studies of the variations in the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the RCo2-based compounds show that the magnetovolume effect plays a decisive role in determining the nature of magnetic transitions and hence the magnetocaloric effect MCE in these compounds. It is found that the spin fluctuations arising from the magnetovolume effect reduce the strength of IEM which subsequently lead to a reduction in the MCE. Most of the substitutions at the Co site are found to result in a positive magnetovolume effect leading to an initial increase in the ordering temperature. Application of pressure on the other hand causes a reduction in the ordering temperature due to the negative magnetovolume effect. A comparative study of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of RCo2 compounds under various substitutions and applied pressure is presented. Analysis of the magnetization data using the Landau theory of magnetic phase transitions has shown that there is a strong correlation between the Landau coefficients and the MCE. The variations seen in the order of magnetic transition and the MCE values seem to support the recent model proposed by Khmelevskyi and Mohn for the occurrence of IEM in RCo2 compounds. Metastable nature of the transition metal sublattice in RCo2-based compounds and its role in determining the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties is explained. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Our measurements show no thermal hysteresis across the magnetic transition for the parent compound which is in contrast with the previous report and corroborate the second order nature of the transition. The magnetic transition could be tuned continuously from 328 K to 212 K with Mn substitution at the Fe site. The Mn substitution leads to a linear increase in the unit cell volume and a slight reduction in the effective moment. A detailed critical analysis of the magnetization data for x 0.0 and 0.2 is performed in the critical regime using the modified Arrott plots Kouvel-Fisher plot universal curve scaling and scaling analysis of magnetocaloric effect. The magnetization isotherms follow modified Arrott plots with critical exponent 0.308 1.448 and 5.64 for the parent compound x 0.0 and 0.304 1.445 and 5.64 for x 0.2.

The exchange interaction decays as J r r 3.41 following the renormalization group theory and the observed critical exponents correspond to lattice dimensionality d 2 spin dimensionality n 1 and the range of interaction 1.41. This value of 2 indicates long-range interaction between magnetic spins. A reasonable magnetocaloric effect Sm 6.67 J/Kg-K and 5.84 J/Kg-K for x 0.0 and 0.2 compounds respectively with a huge relative cooling power RCP 700 J/Kg for 9 T magnetic field change is observed. The universal scaling of magnetocaloric effect further mimics the second order character of the magnetic transition. The obtained critical exponents from the critical analysis of magnetocaloric effect agree with the values deduced from the magnetic isotherm analysis.},

The compound undergoes an antiferromagnetic AFM ordering around TN 4.6 K and magnetic correlation is observed above TN up to T 11 K. Below TN a spin-glass state was observed for ErCoSn due to an apparent coexistence of ferromagnetic FM interaction with long-range AFM order. External applied magnetic field induces a first-order-like metamagnetic phase transition from AFM to FM state that is responsible for the large values of the maximum isothermal entropy change Mmax 16.5 J/kgK 50 kOe and adiabatic temperature change Tad 8.2 K . Furthermore short-range ferromagnetic correlation above TN contributes to the widening of SM and Tad peaks as well as the increase of the ErCoSn compound refrigerant capacity.

In a material displaying the MCE the alignment of randomly oriented magnetic moments by an external magnetic field results in heating. This heat can then be removed from the MCE material to the ambient atmosphere by heat transfer. If the magnetic field is subsequently turned off the magnetic moments randomize again which leads to cooling of the material below the ambient temperature. Here we report the discovery of a large magnetic entropy change in MnFeP0.45As0.55 a material that has a Curie temperature of about 300 K and which allows magnetic refrigeration at room temperature. The magnetic entropy changes reach values of 14.5 J K-1 kg-1 and 18 J K-1 kg-1 for field changes of 2 T and 5 T respectively. The so-called giant-MCE material Gd5Ge2Si2 ref. 2 displays similar entropy changes but can only be used below room temperature. The refrigerant capacity of our material is also significantly greater than that of Gd ref. 3 . The large entropy change is attributed to a field-induced first-order phase transition enhancing the effect of the applied magnetic field.},

Baptista de Castro et al. NPG Asia Mater. 12 35 2020 . In this study in order to investigate the origin of the gigantic SM in HoB2 we studied the magnetic orderings by neutron diffraction with an enriched powder sample of Ho11B2. Our experimental results showed the onset of ferromagnetic long-range order below TC 15K. For the second phase transition at T2 11K the spin reorientation occurs and the temperature dependence of the total magnetic moment of Ho3 shows a kink anomaly which is typically seen in compounds with quadrupolar ordering. In addition the temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic short-range order above TC is strongly related to that of the magnetic entropy change in HoB2. These results infer that the gigantic SM in HoB2 is caused by i the spin reorientation transition which is likely associated with quadrupolar ordering giving the additional contribution to SM at the lower phase transition temperature T2 11K and ii the large FM fluctuation above TC with origins in the strong suppression of the FM long-range order.},

At present researchers focus mainly on environmentally-friendly magnetic materials and their applications in heating refrigeration and magnetic energy conversion technologies. However one must also pay attention to the increasing number of medical applications of the MCE as e.g. controllable delivery and release of drugs and biomedical substances to defined locations in the human body and applications of magnetic hyperthermia cancer treatment . The first method demands local cooling of thermo-sensitive polymers in the body and the second induces local heating by a magnetic mechanism. In the first part of this article the recent progress in magnetocalorics mainly on materials is reviewed and the possibilities to increase the effect e.g. by studying the interactions of magnetic and structural subsystems of magnetic materials in the vicinity of magnetic phase transitions and critical points are outlined. To determine such and other important phenomena in the MCE dynamic measurements have been developed. In the second part of the article the applications of the MCE in new methods developed for applications in medical fields as briefly mentioned above are introduced and discussed. It is clear that a comprehensive overview on all important developments cannot be given here. Therefore only the most important works are cited with a focus on important developments of Russian research. We ask those authors who have contributed to the MCE and stay unmentioned in this review article for their understanding.},

We calculate the fuel consumption and costs of four diesel-fuelled series hybrid four plug-in hybrid and four fuel cell car configurations and compared these to three reference cars. We find that series hybrid cars may reduce fuel consumption by 34-47 but cost 5000-12 000 more.

Series hybrid cars with wheel motors have lower weight and 7-21 lower fuel consumption than those with central electric motors. The fuel cell car remains uncompetitive even if production costs of fuel cells come down by 90 . Plug-in hybrid cars are competitive when driving large distances on electricity and/or if cost of batteries come down substantially.

While prior examples have demonstrated successful models for some applications many more applications exist where machine learning can make a strong impact. To enable faster development of machine-learning-based models for such applications we have created a framework capable of being applied to a broad range of materials data. Our method works by using a chemically diverse list of attributes which we demonstrate are suitable for describing a wide variety of properties and a novel method for partitioning the data set into groups of similar materials to boost the predictive accuracy. In this manuscript we demonstrate how this new method can be used to predict diverse properties of crystalline and amorphous materials such as band gap energy and glass-forming ability.},

In recent years a broad array of materials property databases have emerged as part of a digital transformation of materials science. However recent technological advances in ML are not fully exploited because of the insufficient volume and diversity of materials data. An ML framework called transfer learning has considerable potential to overcome the problem of limited amounts of materials data. Transfer learning relies on the concept that various property types such as physical chemical electronic thermodynamic and mechanical properties are physically interrelated. For a given target property to be predicted from a limited supply of training data models of related proxy properties are pretrained using sufficient data these models capture common features relevant to the target task. Repurposing of such machine-acquired features on the target task yields outstanding prediction performance even with exceedingly small data sets as if highly experienced human experts can make rational inferences even for considerably less experienced tasks. In this study to facilitate widespread use of transfer learning we develop a pretrained model library called XenonPy.MDL. In this first release the library comprises more than 140 000 pretrained models for various properties of small molecules polymers and inorganic crystalline materials. Along with these pretrained models we describe some outstanding successes of transfer learning in different scenarios such as building models with only dozens of materials data increasing the ability of extrapolative prediction through a strategic model transfer and so on. Remarkably transfer learning has autonomously identified rather nontrivial transferability across different properties transcending the different disciplines of materials science for example our analysis has revealed underlying bridges between small molecules and polymers and between organic and inorganic chemistry.}

	abstract     = {Magnetic refrigeration based on magnetocaloric effect MCE has become a promising alternative technique to the traditional gas-compression refrigeration due to its friendly environment and high energy efficiency. In addition to room temperature magnetic refrigeration this novel technology can be applied at low temperature especially for the potential applications in gas liquefaction. Therefore attention has been paid to explore suitable materials with large MCE near the gas liquefaction temperature and develop low temperature magnetic refrigerators. Herein the typical magnetocaloric materials and prototypes in the temperature range of nitrogen and hydrogen liquefaction are reviewed. Heavy rare earth intermetallic compounds are promising for low temperature magnetic refrigeration due to a low ordering temperature and large magnetic moments. For example DyFeSi compound shows a large reversible MCE under a low field change of 1 T around T C 70 K which is near the liquefaction temperature of nitrogen 77 K . It has been proposed that a composite can be formed by a group of magnetic refrigeration materials with successive transition temperatures and nearly constant MCEs therefore expanding the range of working temperature desirable for Ericsson-cycle magnetic refrigeration.},

A large magnetocaloric effect MCE was observed just above the Curie temperature Tc of these compounds which both undergo a first-order magnetic transition. The isothermal entropy change S and the adiabatic temperature change Tad of these compounds were larger than those of other Laves-phase materials such as RAl2 and RNi2. However the temperature range of the large MCE for these compounds was limited. It has been shown that Tc increases almost linearly against the de Gennes factor and can be controlled by changing the concentration of the rare earth elements while maintaining a first-order transition. By measuring the magnetization and heat capacity we obtained temperature entropy T-S diagrams which are essential for analyzing the magnetic refrigeration cycle. Both series of compounds showed high potential for use in a regenerative thermal cycle especially as a combination of several compositions to cover a wide temperature range. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The TC of the different compositions covers the temperature range 67 K-108 K while TN remains constant at around 133 K. The magnetic entropy change Delta SM T as a function of applied field up to 7 Tesla is characterized by a second-order magnetic phase transition around TN and a first-order transition around TC. The maximum magnetic entropy change around TN is only about 3 J middot kg-1 middot K-1 but it is much larger around TC. It rapidly reaches a saturation plateau of about 40-50 J middot kg-1 middot K-1 which widens with increasing field. The width of the plateau at an applied field of 7 T is about 20 K.

The latter is released by the polymer if the temperature induced by magnetic field due to MCE is changed. The polymer undergoes sharp phase transition in response to the slight temperature drop of 1 3 C down to 34 36 C in the body . Local cooling is achieved with FeRh alloy one of the most perspective MCE materials with the first order phase transition. It is critically important to take into account several peculiarities of phase transition and MCE behavior in these series of alloys. Recent studies on high-purity samples showed an irreversible effect of MCE indicating that the temperature of FeRh does not return to its initial value after the full cycle of the magnetic field during dynamic MCE measurements. A theoretical explanation based on ab initio calculations has been provided. Magnetic hyperthermia in oncology is rapidly developing therapeutic modality. Recent experiments have shown that Mn-Zn ferrite emerges as a cost-effective material for this method compared with currently used magnetite nanoparticles. We present our achievements on magnetically guided capsule endoscopy. The advances in magnetically guided capsule endoscopy are also discussed. We provide the experimental setup for the computer-controlled system of magnetic field sources that create necessary forces to control the position of the capsule in five degrees of freedom in a given area.

	abstract     = {Quantities are financial, technological, physical and other measures that denote relevant properties of entities, such as revenue of companies, energy efficiency of cars or distance and brightness of stars and galaxies. Queries with filter conditions on quantities are an important building block for downstream analytics, and pose challenges when the content of interest is spread across a huge number of web tables and other ad-hoc datasets. Search engines support quantity lookups, but largely fail on quantity filters. The QuTE system presented in this paper aims to overcome these problems. It comprises methods for automatically extracting entity-quantity facts from web tables, as well as methods for online query processing, with new techniques for query matching and answer ranking.},

The study uses Science Citation Index of ISI Thomson Reuters Web of Science for the period from 2002 to 2016 (for a period of fifteen years) of top fifteen countries in the field of Materials Science. The indicators used in this study are Relative Growth Rate (RGR), Doubling Time (Dt.), Activity Index (AI), Publication Efficiency Index (PEI), Relative Comparative Advantage for Publication (RCAP). The findings of the study reveal that the percentage share of Materials Science publications of the World is 5.61 out of the total scientific publications of the World; the study indicates that China topped the table with 2,87,736 publications, followed by the USA (2,17,422); there is an exponential growth of publication for the world (R2 = 0.967) in Materials Science field; the Annual Growth Rate (RGR) is highest for Iran (through it ranked fifteenth in terms of publications), i.e. 27.00; Activity Index is more than one for nine countries which indicates that the research efforts of these countries correspond to the worlds average; It is evident from the study that the USA (1.48), England (1.19), Australia (1.14), Germany (1.09) and France (1.07) have more than one PEI which clearly indicates that there is an impact of publications in Materials Science by these countries is more than the research effort devoted during 2002 to 2016; China topped the list with the highest mean value of Relative Comparative Advantage for Publication (RCAP) i.e. 2.23. RCAP value of China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Iran, Japan, Russia and France are more than one. The data indicate that these countries are specialised in the field of Materials Science.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}

	abstract     = {Open Access (OA) is a model for publishing scholarly peer reviewed journals, made possible by the Internet. The full text of OA journals and articles can be freely read, as the publishing is funded through means other than subscriptions. Empirical research concerning the quantitative development of OA publishing has so far consisted of scattered individual studies providing brief snapshots, using varying methods and data sources. This study adopts a systematic method for studying the development of OA journals from their beginnings in the early 1990s until 2009. Because no comprehensive index of OA articles exists, systematic manual data collection from journal web sites was conducted based on journal-level data extracted from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Due to the high number of journals registered in the DOAJ, almost 5000 at the time of the study, stratified random sampling was used. A separate sample of verified early pioneer OA journals was also studied. The results show a very rapid growth of OA publishing during the period 1993–2009. During the last year an estimated 191 000 articles were published in 4769 journals. Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18% for the number of journals and 30% for the number of articles. This can be contrasted to the reported 3,5% yearly volume increase in journal publishing in general. In 2009 the share of articles in OA journals, of all peer reviewed journal articles, reached 7,7%. Overall, the results document a rapid growth in OA journal publishing over the last fifteen years. Based on the sampling results and qualitative data a division into three distinct periods is suggested: The Pioneering years (1993–1999), the Innovation years (2000–2004), and the Consolidation years (2005–2009).}

But due to the diversity of naming conventions and traditions for such molecules, this task is highly complex and should be supported by computational tools.Results: We present ChemSpot, a named entity recognition (NER) tool for identifying mentions of chemicals in natural language texts, including trivial names, drugs, abbreviations, molecular formulas and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry entities. Since the different classes of relevant entities have rather different naming characteristics, ChemSpot uses a hybrid approach combining a Conditional Random Field with a dictionary. It achieves an F1 measure of 68.1\\% on the SCAI corpus, outperforming the only other freely available chemical NER tool, OSCAR4, by 10.8 percentage points.Availability: ChemSpot is freely available at: http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/wbi/resourcesContact:leser@informatik.hu-berlin.de}},

Features extracted based on thermal conductivity, atomic radius, valence, electron affinity, and atomic mass contribute the most to the model’s predictive accuracy. It is crucial to note that our model does not predict whether a material is a superconductor or not; it only gives predictions for superconductors.}
