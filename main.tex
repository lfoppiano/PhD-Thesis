\item{Degree Program:}
  Name of degree program should be entered in {\tt $\backslash$programfield}.
\item{Date:}
  Month and year of completion should be entered in {\tt $\backslash$graduatemonth} and {\tt $\backslash$graduateyear}, respectively. 
\end{description}

\section{Main body}

The body of the text should be in one column.

Tables and figures are numbered, captioned and referred to in the
text. Tables \ref{table:fundamental_data_type} and figure
ref{figure:sample} are examples of tables and figures
respectively.
%
The description of the table is often written above and the
description of the figure below.
%
The package used to insert the figure The package used to insert the
figure should be chosen freely according to the environment in which
it is used.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\caption{Sample of Table}
\label{table:fundamental_data_type}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | r | r | r | r |}
\hline
Fiscal Year & 1st & 2nd & 3rd & 4th \\
\hline
1995 & 85 & 92 & 86 & 88 \\
1996 & 83 & 89 & 90 & 102 \\
1997 & 88 & 87 & 91 & 112 \\
