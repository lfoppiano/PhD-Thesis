\section{Introduction}

This Chapter presents the database we constructed through an automatic process that leverages the work presented in this dissertation. 
This is the main contribution of our work: SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} Database. 
We processed 37770 research articles in PDF format belonging to the category \textit{ cond-mat.supr-cond} in ArXiv\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org/archive/cond-mat}}. We obtained 40324 records of superconductor materials with their respective properties and conditions, including \tc, applied pressure measurement methods. 
We presented a novel data flow that ingests PDF documents (Chatpter~\ref{cha:pdf_extraction}), combining traditional ML architectures with a novel process that extracts materials and properties (Chapters~\ref{cha:extraction-experimental-data} and~\ref{cha:measurements}) and construct a database automatically.
This work represents a novel approach to TDM for material informatics. 
Compared with other methods, our work does not need to be adapted to the data source, whether ArXiv, BioRXiv, ChemRXiv, or any proprietary publisher article.  

SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} Database is an efficient, parallel flow of data ingestion and not a replacement for SuperCon.
Considering the strict quality requirements that SuperCon must meet and the fact that automatic processes are imperfect, the data must be validated before being accepted in SuperCon.  
Compared to the original SuperCon construction, SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} Database was collected in a few days. 
The updated data model counted new properties: 2052 triplets with applied pressure (\textit{material-\tc-pressure}) and 3602 records with an explicit measurement method (\textit{material-\tc-measurement method}).

In this chapter, we discuss how SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} is built, including the technical information about the data format and the processing. 


\section{Database construction}
\label{sec:ingestion}

The ingestion process (Figure~\ref{fig:map-reduce}) is designed using an Extract-Aggregate approach, implemented through Grobid-superconductors (see chapters~\ref{cha:pdf_extraction} and~\ref{cha:extraction-experimental-data}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption{Ingestion process. The numbers between parentheses represent the order in which each operation is performed. }
  \label{fig:map-reduce}
\end{figure}

Storage is implemented using MongoDB~\footnote{\url{https://www.mongodb.com}}, an open-source document database, and the collections are designed as different stages in the processing: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{binary} collection contains the original PDF documents 
    \item the \textbf{documents} collection contains the structured document
    \item \textbf{tabular} collection stores the summarised records, and finally 
    \item \textbf{logger} contains detailed information on the status of the process of each document, including possible errors. More details are given in Section~\ref{subsec:curation-and-processing-logs}.
    \item \textbf{training\_data} Used to collect training examples in and discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:feedback-loop-training-data}.
\end{itemize}


The "Extraction Task" takes the PDF documents in input and transforms them into a rich representation document that includes text passages (sentences, paragraphs), annotations, and tokens as JSON files, which we will refer to as \textit{structured documents} (Figure~\ref{fig:data-flow-2}). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/curation/data-flow-2} 
  \caption{Example of the information from one single entity from a passage extracted in the "Extraction Task". The different structured information is highlighted: links, attributes, PDF entities coordinate (to visualise annotations on the PDF document), and annotations references within the passage (to visualise annotations on text).}
  \label{fig:data-flow-2}
\end{figure}

Each passage comprises the following attributes: the text, the type (whether a sentence or paragraph), the main section: header, body, and annexe, and the subsections: title, abstract, paragraph, and caption.
Furthermore, a passage contains the list of spans representing the extracted entities and a list of layout tokens. 
The spans are characterised by text, type, attributes, a unique identifier, and other internal information (e.g. from which ML model the entity was extracted). 
The attributes are stored as a key-value and mainly contain information extracted by the material parser, such as the chemical formula, the structured composition, the material class, etc.
The layout tokens contain low-level information coming from the PDF document: font size, font face, superscript, subscript, bold, italic, and coordinates within the PDF document. The coordinates are pairs of "x" and "y" numbers that are used to build annotation "boxes" to encapsulate each token independently (see Figure~\ref{fig:pdf-view} in the following chapter as an example). 

The "Aggregation Task" takes the structured document as input and reduces it to a table format where each row (referred to as a \textit{summarised record}, or, \textit{record}) pivots around the relation materials-Tc and attaches additional elements to it. 
The number of aggregated records can increase when large entities are extracted and may contain condensed information referring to multiple materials. 
For example, the raw material "Zn and CU doping La Fe B" will be aggregated as two records (doping: Zn, formula: La Fe B) and (doping: Cu, formula: La Fe B). 

In the following listing, we illustrate an example of an aggregated record: lines 2-21 contain the record information such as material name, \tc, pressure, etc. Lines 22-34 represent the span list, which is the original annotation information. They are used to link the aggregated records back to the original structure document information. 
Line 35, 'hash' is a unique signature of the original document using the first 10 characters of the MD5 hash function on the binary content. We use this information to link the original document, the structured document, and the summarised records.
'type', 'timestamp' and 'status' are internal workflow information discussed in the next chapter. 
The rest of the lines contain the bibliographic data (39-42).

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results-supercon2}

Compared to the original SuperCon, SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} was collected in a few days. There is no information about how SuperCon was constructed, only that it started in 1987~\cite{ishii2023structuring}. 
When we built the new process to obtain SuperCon\textsuperscript{2}, following domain-expert guidance, we considered two pieces of information: ``applied pressure'' and ``measurement method'' that have not been collected systematically in SuperCon.
``Applied pressure'' is the pressure applied to make the material a superconductor and has gained attention because it can radically change the physical structure of a material. 
On the other hand, the ``measurement method'' is how scientists measured the superconducting transition temperature \tc~and can be used to semantically recognise multiple \tc~obtained from the same material or sample. 
In particular, identifying calculated properties is fundamental when providing data for predictions. 
These properties were present only for a minority of records in SuperCon and, we hypothesise, were not considered in the initial design. The fact that applied pressure was recorded in different database fields suggests that such action was more a curator's decision than a methodological change.
The resulting SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} counted 2052 triplets with applied pressure (\textit{material-\tc-pressure}), and 3602 records with an explicit measurement method (\textit{material-\tc-measurement method}).
The SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} schema is discussed in~\ref{sec:results-supercon2} with examples in Table~\ref{tab:supercon2-schema}. 

Our TDM process is limited to text, whereas the manual process focuses on plots and tables. This limitation reduces the density of the collected data, as observed by the amount of information (33,000 records) extracted from only 7227 articles. Such additions should be built as separate projects.
However, the automatic process cannot be used without manual validation, given the high-quality constraints of SuperCon. This allows combining the TDM process with data curation in a homogeneous flow described in Chapter~\ref{cha:curation}.

\section{Conclusions}

SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} Database represents the result of our effort to build an automatic TDM process to extract experimental data automatically. As a consequence, this is the main contribution of this dissertation. 
Applying techniques and methodologies described in the previous chapters allowed us to collect a large database in a few days. SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} Database was composed of 40324 records of superconductor materials and properties, including additional properties such as the applied pressure and the \tc~measurement method, which were not systematically collected in SuperCon. This database is available in various formats at \url{https://github.com/lfoppiano/supercon}.
